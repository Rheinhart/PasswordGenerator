#Requirement Document - Password Generator
## Task Description
Create a REST Api that generates a secure password. The user should be able to configure the minimum length, the number of special characters, and the number of numbers. Then generate a password for the user using those inputs.

## Example:
Minimum length: 8 Special characters: 2 Numbers: 2
The generated password is: aurn2$1s#

## Challenges
- Randomly convert vowels to numbers, such as 3 for E and 4 for A.
- Have the program present a few options rather than a single result.
